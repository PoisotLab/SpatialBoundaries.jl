    TriangulationWomble{T <: Number} <: Womble

A set of data (and co-ordinates) that are irregularly arranged in space are of
type `TriangulationWomble` after having been passed through `wombling` - the
fields in this type are

  - `m`, a *vector* of rate of change at each (x,y) co-ordinate
  - `θ`, a *vector* of direction of change at each (x,y) co-ordinate
  - `x` and `y`, the coordinates of the barycenter of each triangle in the plan

Note that the type of `x` and `y` should be the same as the element type of ` m`
and `θ`, because these values are all used when calculating the rate of change
and that `x` and `y` correspond to latitude and longitude respectively.
