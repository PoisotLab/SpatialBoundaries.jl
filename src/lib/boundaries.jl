    boundaries(W::Womble, t=0.1; ignorezero=false)

Extracts candidate boundaries using calculated wombling object `W` on specified
threshold `t`. Default threshold is 0.1, meaning that the top 10% of pixels are
selected as part of the boundaries. This function returns a list of indices
identifying which simplices are part of the boundaries. The NaN values in the
rates of change are not going to be a part of the boundaries. The keyword
`ignorezero`, which defaults to `false`, can be used to remove the points with
a rate of change of 0.
